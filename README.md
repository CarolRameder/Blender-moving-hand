# Lab3---IMR

The moving hand is created in Blender starting from a cube, by remodeling and adding new forms. The structure has a armature 
which helps during the 'grab' movement and simmulates the bones of a real hand . The model is exported as fbx, 
in order to have both the movement and the structure . The animation is shown by pressing the 'G' key in a Unity simulation .
